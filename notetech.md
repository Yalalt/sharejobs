```ts
// Set cookie
response.cookies.set('__session', token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000, // 1 day
  path: '/',
  sameSite: 'lax',
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
});
```

The code above is setting a cookie named `__session` in the response object. The cookie is being set with the `token` value, which is likely a JSON Web Token (JWT) that has been signed with a secret key. The `httpOnly` option is set to `true`, which means that the cookie cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript code. This is a security measure to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The `maxAge` option is set to `60 * 60 * 24 * 1000`, which is equivalent to 1 day in milliseconds. This means that the cookie will expire after 1 day and the user will need to log in again to get a new token.

The `path` option is set to `'/'`, which means that the cookie will be available to all pages on the website. The `sameSite` option is set to `'lax'`, which means that the cookie will only be sent in cross-site requests if the method is safe (e.g. GET) and the user has interacted with the site that is making the request. This is a security measure to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

The `secure` option is set to `true` if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `'production'`. This means that the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS connections, which is a security measure to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Overall, this code is setting a secure cookie that will expire after 1 day and can only be accessed by server-side code. This is a common technique used in web applications to manage user sessions and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
